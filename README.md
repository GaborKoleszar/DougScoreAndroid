An unofficial app for displaying cars rated by Doug Demuro. It downloads the xlsx file from Doug's Google Drive, parses it with the Apache poi-ooxml library and stores it in room. Upon further starts, the app only uses the local cache to display the list faster, but there is a refresh option in the settings page. The app supports both dynamic color theming and dark/light modes.
